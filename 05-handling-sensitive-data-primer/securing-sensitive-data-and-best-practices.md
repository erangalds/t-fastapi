# Securing Sensitive Data and Best Practices

+ **Validation and Sanitization**: Using *Pydantic Data Models* to validate and sanitize user input and output responses. Be mindful of the data that will be output to the user as well as to the logs. Sensitive information should always be redacted or anonymized to prevent accidental disclosure. 
+ **Access Control**: Setup access control mechanisms to ensure that users can only access the data they are entitled to. Basically try to implement role-based-access-control (RBAC). Authorization and Permission checks and handleing user authentications is critical in any application. 
+ **Secure Communication**: use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. 
+ **Database Security**: Configure database level security. Use secure connections. Always avoid exposing database publically. Apply the principle of least privilege. to database access. 
+ **Regular updates**: Keep all the code and used libraries up to date.
+ **Data Storage**: Store sensitive data only when required. Always encrypt the data storage.
+ **Data Transmission**: Use secure APIs and be mindful of integrating with external API or services.
+ **Data Retention and Deletion**: Setup clear data retention and deletion policies. 
+ **Monitoring and Loggins**: Setup logging and monitoring. This enables to detec unusual access patterns or potential breaches. Be mindful of what you log. Avoid logging sensitive data. Store the logs securely and provide access to logs only to authorized personnel.
